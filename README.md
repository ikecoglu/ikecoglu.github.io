# Testing Setup

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for basic unit tests. To run the tests:

1. Install dependencies once:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the test suite:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

The test suite currently validates that the publication sorting logic orders entries from newest to oldest.
